Title: Under the Sea Game

Description: This is an underwater themed video game. The user's goal is to "catch" bubbles to gain points. The user begins with five lives and will lose one every time they collide with the fish that swim across the screen. Every time the user's score hits a multiple of 100, they increase a level and the game gets harder as the fish get faster. 

How to Use: 
1. The up arrow key allows the user to jump in order to avoid the fish
2. The user places their cursor over the pink bubbles that appear on the screen to generate a sparkle
3. When they move the cursor off the pink bubbles, the sparkle will "shoot" the bubbles and the user's score will increase.
4. There are "special bubbles" that the user can catch in order to regain a life
5. The "special bubbles" are green, and the user can click them when the briefly appear on the screen in order to catch them
