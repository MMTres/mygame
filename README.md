Title: Under the Sea Game

Description: This is an underwater themed video game. The user's goal is to "catch" bubbles to gain points. The user begins with five lives and will lose one every time they collide with the fish that swim across the screen. 

How to Use: The up arrow key allows the user to jump in order to avoid the fish. The user places their cursor over the pink bubbles that appear on the screen to generate a sparkle, and when they move their cursor, the sparkle will "shoot" the bubbles and the user's score will increase.
